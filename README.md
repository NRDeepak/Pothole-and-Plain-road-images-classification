Introduction: 


Roads are essential to transportation, providing a means for people to travel from one place to another. However, maintenance of roads can be challenging, especially with the occurrence of potholes. Potholes are common problems on roads that can cause significant damage to vehicles and even lead to accidents. It is essential to detect and repair potholes as soon as possible in order to avoid such problems.

In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become a popular technique for image classification. This article explores how to use a CNN to classify images of Potholes and Plain roads.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a type of deep learning neural network commonly used for image classification and object detection tasks. They are called convolutional networks because they use convolutional layers, which involve sliding filters over the input image to detect specific features. They are capable of automatically learning the features and representations necessary for image classification, without the need for manual feature extraction.
